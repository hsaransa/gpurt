Brief guide to code
-------------------

The code includes a lot of features that have very little to do with CUDA
ray tracing. This is because the ray tracer was originally implemented
in my another project.



cudabvh.cpp and cudabvh.hpp
These files are used to convert bvh tree to arrays used by CUDA ray tracer.
